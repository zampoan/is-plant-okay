# Is-Plant-Okay üå±?
## Concept
A solar-powered sensor node that uses a low-power camera and a tiny on-board ML model to detect early signs of plant disease. It will be mounted on a stake and its purpose is to continuously watch the same plant or section of crop bed. 

It will periodically take a picture every 4 hours. When it sees trouble, it will send a compact alert packet over LoRa to a base station. The farmer will receive a notification and can inspect or treat the plant before disease spreads

## Model layout
The model that will be used is based of the paper: [AI and IoT-powered edge device optimized for crop pest and disease detection](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-06452-5). It is called Tiny-LiteNet, and it uses a pretrained MobileNetv2 model as a teacher model. Tiny-LiteNet utilises six squeeze-and-excitation (SE) depthwise blocks to enhance feature representation, reduce compute cost and improve accuracy combined. The size of this model is 1.2Mb.
